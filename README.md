# End-to-End ML Deployment: Boston House Price Prediction

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning lifecycle — from model development to deployment — using the Boston Housing dataset. A regression model was built using Scikit-learn, then deployed as a RESTful API using Flask, containerized with Docker, and hosted on AWS EC2 for real-time predictions.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Flask (REST API)
- Docker (containerization)
- AWS EC2 (deployment)

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training with hyperparameter tuning
- Flask-based REST API for inference
- Dockerized app for consistent deployment
- Hosted on EC2 for public access

## Use Case
Real-time prediction of Boston house prices based on input features like crime rate, number of rooms, and property tax.
